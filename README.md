## Integration of adversarial autoencoders with residual dense convolutional networks for estimation of non-Gaussian conductivities

## Update (2021-3-13): We have now uploaded the codes of 3D-DRDCN. For 2D problems, one can replace the 3D opterations (e.g., convolution and batchnorm) with their 2D counterparts in net design file (i.e. rrde_ed3D.py).
